## Exploring Collabotative Augmented Reality Under Internet Issues

This page contains videos that supplement our research on how internet issues (particularly outages) affect users' collaboratove behaviour during joint Augmented Reality tasks. 

This research focuses on collaborative where two users, wearing Augmented Reality headsets, collaborate using 3D virtual models. 

In these videos, one user acts as a helper, who provides instructions or advise, while another user, the worker, perform manipulations on the 3D virtual models.

### Effects of Different Types of Losses on Movements of 3D Virtual Objects / Models

### User's Coping Mechanisms to Deal With the Effects of Outages  
#### Batching Instructions
<div class="myDiv1">
  <p>This video shows a helper batching instructions in the face of outages, so that the worker has enough information to proeed with the task in case another outage occurs. </p>
