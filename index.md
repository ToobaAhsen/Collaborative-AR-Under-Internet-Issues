## Exploring Collabotative Augmented Reality Under Internet Issues

This page contains videos that supplement our research on how internet issues (particularly outages) affect users' collaboratove behaviour during joint Augmented Reality tasks. 

This research focuses on collaborative where two users, wearing Augmented Reality headsets, collaborate using 3D virtual models. 

In these videos, one user acts as a helper, who provides instructions or advise, while another user, the worker, perform manipulations on the 3D virtual models.
